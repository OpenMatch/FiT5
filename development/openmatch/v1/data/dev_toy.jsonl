Considering the existing limited global supply and competition for PPE and face masks, it is therefore expected that severe shortages of protective face masks will be encountered for some countries and communities. While we all hope that such situations will not develop, the time is now to prepare for a worst-case scenario in which the demand for face masks cannot be sustained.

Our findings showed the opposite trend. Specific precautionary measures including avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks), hand hygiene, and wearing masks regardless of the presence or absence of symptoms were associated with lower levels of psychological impact, depression, anxiety, and stress. The experiences of the 2003 SARS-CoV epidemic could have changed the perception of the general public towards precautionary measures and have led to a positive effect on the initial psychological responses to the COVID-19 epidemic by giving respondents confidence and sense of control in prevention. As the Chinese prefer to use chopsticks to pick up food commonly shared on a plate during mealtime as part of their culture, it is not unexpected that avoidance of sharing utensils (e.g., chopsticks) during meals is significantly associated with less psychological impact and lower levels of anxiety, depression, and stress.

While diseases with a large proportion of symptomatic cases may result in most carriers reducing personal contacts (by choice or incapacity), Covid-19 is thought to have a high proportion of mildly symptomatic or asymptomatic cases, and therefore more infectious persons unaware of their status may continue to expose others. As such, even if masks offer limited personal protection, a general recommendation to wear masks in public may be particularly beneficial by containing transmission from unknowingly infectious persons. Some countries have seen an enormous demand for face masks from the public, with supplies being diminished and shortages reported [7] , drawing criticism for limiting supplies in healthcare facilities. Even with lesser public demand, the United States reported mask shortages among healthcare workers [24] . Recognizing the need for masks, the Central Epidemic Command Center (CECC) in Taiwan made efforts to increase mask production from January and announced when, where, and how to wear masks [25] .

In the situation we describe, 85% of health care workers were exposed during an aerosol-generating procedure exposed while wearing a surgical mask, and the remainder were wearing N95 masks. That none of the health care workers in this situation acquired infection suggests that surgical masks, hand hygiene, and other standard procedures protected them from being infected. Our observation is consistent with previous studies that have been unable to show that N95 masks were superior to surgical masks for preventing influenza infection in health care workers (5) .", "label": 2, "query_id": "THUMSR-36", "doc_id": "xuv77kp6_0", "retrieval_score": 17.043457}
